                    <p>Provide expertise on all considerations for aeronautical FMS and flight planning data in

                        support of the new ADVaT aeronautical validation software suite for DAFIF and FLIP

                        products. This tool is in development for use by military aviation assets each

                        aeronautical cycle and is intended to improve the quality and viability of NGA’s DAFIF

                        product for use in JMPS, FalconView, PFPS, AMPS and other DOD mission planning

                        programs. Quality assurance is a job function central to flight safety. Ability to author

                        SQL scripts is required to trouble-shoot software. Aeronautical data analysis via Excel

                        and Access is frequently required. Utilize MS Access and MS SQL Server to data-mine

                        and identify points of comparison between DAFIF and ARINC 424. Ensure aeronautical

                        data integrity is maintained in accordance with RTCA DO-200A standards.</p>
